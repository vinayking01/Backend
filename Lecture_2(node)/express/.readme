## MongoDB locally using Monogo Shell

```javascript

To work with MongoDB locally using the Mongo shell, you need to follow these steps:

1. Start the MongoDB Server:
Open Command Prompt and run the following command to start the MongoDB server:mongod

This starts the MongoDB server, which listens for incoming connections on port 27017 (default). Keep this Command Prompt open and running because it is essential for the server to be active for the Mongo shell to connect.

2. Open a New Command Prompt for Mongo Shell: 
In a new Command Prompt window, type the : mongosh

The mongosh command launches the MongoDB Shell, which allows you to interact with your MongoDB server by running queries, inserting documents, etc. This shell will connect to the MongoDB server that you started in the previous step.
and start running commands like show dbs to view available databases, or use <dbName> to switch to a specific database.

Note - The mongod command starts the MongoDB server process. Without this running, there is no active database to connect to, and the shell will not be able to execute commands or queries.

```

## Mongo DB compass 
- MongoDB Compass is a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with MongoDB databases. It provides an easy way to visualize, query, and analyze your MongoDB data. MongoDB Compass allows you to connect to both local MongoDB instances (running on your computer) and online MongoDB clusters (such as MongoDB Atlas).
- Common Requirements -> Download and install MongoDB Community Edition - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-mongodb-on-windows/

### 1. Connecting to a Local MongoDB Instance using MonogoDB Compass 
- When you connect to a local MongoDB instance via MongoDB Compass, you do not need to manually run mongosh. When you connect locally using MongoDB Compass, the GUI automatically connects to the MongoDB server running on your machine (e.g., at localhost:27017).
- MongoDB Compass communicates directly with the MongoDB Server (started by the mongod process) without the need for a shell like mongosh to be running in the background.


### 2. Connecting to an Online MongoDB Instance
- Create an account on MongoDB
- Create cluster 
- Once the cluster is set up, go to the Clusters tab in MongoDB Atlas.
- Click on Connect for your cluster, and select "Connect with MongoDB Compass".
- You will be provided with a connection string (similar to the following):
`mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/test`
- Open MongoDB Compass on your local machine. and add their connection.
